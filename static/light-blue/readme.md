Light Blue v1.5 (September 26)
=========

Light Blue is a **next generation** admin dashboard template based on the latest **Flat** design. There are few reasons why we have created it:.

  - We didn't like the darkness of most of admin templates, so we created this **light** one.
  - We didn't like the high contrast of most of admin templates, so we created this **unobtrusive** one.
  - We searched for a solution of how to make widgets look like real widgets, so we decided that **deep background** - is what makes widgets look real.

**Light Blue** works great with all range of devices: starting from small mobile to large desktop ones.
**Light Blue** will make the development of your next web application or admin entrance for it much easier and faster. It is based on great Bootstrap framework and uses powerful Sass (CSS preprocessor) technology.
